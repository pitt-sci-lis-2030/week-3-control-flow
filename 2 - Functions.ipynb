These are words like \"print\" and \"type\" we've seen above. Pick function names that make sense and that are easy to recall.\n",

When calling a function, arguments are \"passed\" by naming them inside the parentheses, `()`, after the function name.  Above the string value, \"hello\" is the single argument passed to the functions. Functions can pass more than one argument when they are separated by comma, `,`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Return value** - All functions \"do some work\" by taking some input (argument) and producing an output called the return value. Note, some functions will take an input but don't return anything.  Print is an example of a function that does not return a new value.  We call these functions \"void\" functions, meaning their return type is void.  The other functions above have return values.  Type returns a variable type; max and min return a single character string; `len` returns an int."
